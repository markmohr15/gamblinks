<h3> What is Gamblinks? </h3>
<div> Gamblinks is a social network site for sharing links about gambling.  Members are encouraged to submit links to helpful gambling information and comment on other submissions.  Members can vote on the links and the comments.  Members can also follow other members and be notified by email when someone you follow submits a link. </div>
<h3> About the creator of Gamblinks </h3>
<div> My name is Mark Mohr.  I gambled professionally, playing online poker and betting sports for just under four years.  I continue to earn money gambling, but am now a part-time gambler.  I also have six years experience in financial services, primarily on trade desks.  I recently quit my job on a trade desk to pursue a career in web development.  I just graduated from  <a href="http://interfaceschool.com" target="_blank"> Interface, </a> a 10 week high intensive web development program. </div>
<h3> Why Gamblinks? </h3>
<div> Gamblinks initially started as a school project.  It's the first project I built from scratch and completely finished.  It seems fitting to combine an old passion with a new passion. </div>
<h3> Tech Specs </h3>
<div> The site is built with Ruby on Rails.  The voting process is done with AJax/Javascript.  All of the CSS/HTML was generated by me - no frameworks this time - and it's responsive too!</div>
<h3> Comments/Feedback/Just want to say hi? </h3>
